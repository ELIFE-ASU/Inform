= Empirical Distributions

The link:index.html#inform_dist[`inform_dist`] struct provides an _empirical_ distribution,
i.e. a histogram, representing the observed frequencies of some fixed-sized set of events.
This structure is the basis for all of the fundamental information measures provided on
discrete probability distributions.

The purpose of the link:index.html#inform_dist[`inform_dist`] is to make writing custom
implementations of information-theoretic measures possible. Most of the measures implemented
in *Inform* use this structure at their core.
