= Time Series Measures
The link:index.html#_empirical_distributions[Emperical Distributions] and
link:index.html#_shannon_information_measures[Shannon Information Measures] come
together to make information measures on time series almost trivial to
implement. Every such measure amounts to constructing distributions and applying
and information measure.

== Notation
Throughout this section, we will denote random variables as
latexmath:[X,Y,\ldots], and let latexmath:[x_i, y_i, \ldots] represent the
latexmath:[i]-th time step of a time series drawn from a random variable. Many
of the measures consider latexmath:[k]-histories (a.k.a latexmath:[k]-blocks)
of the time series, e.g.
latexmath:[x_i^{(k)} = \{x_{i-k+1}, x_{i-k+2}, \ldots, x_i\}].

For the sake of conciseness, when denoting probability distributions, we will
only make the random variable explicit in situations where the notation is
ambiguous. Generally, we will write latexmath:[p(x_i)], latexmath:[p(x_i^{(k)})]
and latexmath:[p(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1})] to denote the emperical probability of
observing the latexmath:[x_i] state, the latexmath:[x_i^{(k)}]
latexmath:[k]-history, and the joint probability of observing
latexmath:[\left(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1}\right)], respectively.
